## 1. What Are Large Language Models?
Historically, computers were limited to understanding a defined set of instructions, typically written in programming languages like Java. However, as computing technology advanced, the need for computers to comprehend natural language commands, such as English, became apparent.

Large language models (LLMs) are deep learning algorithms capable of recognizing, summarizing, translating, predicting, and generating text and other content based on extensive dataset knowledge. They find applications beyond language understanding, including tasks in healthcare, software development, and various fields. 

LLMs extend their capabilities to areas like computer code and biology, enabling innovative solutions and creativity. They play a crucial role in diverse applications such as drug discovery, content generation, and reimagining search engines, enhancing AI's reach and impact across industries.

### 1.1. Beginning of NLP
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an interdisciplinary subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence. Its goal is to enable computers to understand texts and other media in their natural languages, including their contextual nuances.

- The roots of NLP can be traced back to the 1950s when Alan Turing introduced the Turing test as a measure of artificial intelligence. In the early stages, NLP relied on rule-based approaches to emulate natural language understanding.
- In the 1980s, advancements in computational power and the adoption of machine learning techniques for language processing led to the development of statistical NLP. Initially, supervised learning was used, particularly in machine translation. However, the field shifted towards semi-supervised and unsupervised learning as the internet generated vast amounts of raw language data. 
- A key tool in NLP applications is language modeling.

### 1.2. Language Modeling (LM)
- LM uses statistical and probabilistic techniques to determine the probability of word sequences in sentences, represented as P(x^{(t+1)}|x^{(t)},...,x^{(1)}).
- **Text Corpus:** Language models generate probabilities by learning from one or more text corpora, large structured sets of texts in one or multiple languages.
- **N-gram Approach:** One of the earliest language modeling approaches uses n-grams, where the probability of the next word depends on a fixed-size window of previous words.
- **Neural Language Models:** Neural language models, based on neural networks, employ continuous representations of words to make predictions. They avoid the curse of dimensionality in language modeling.
- **Architectures:** Several neural network architectures have been proposed for language modeling, offering flexibility and improvements over traditional n-gram models.

## 2. Large Language Models (LLMs)
Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful neural language models working on a massive scale. These models consist of neural networks with billions of parameters and are typically trained on vast amounts of unlabeled text data.

### 2.1. Key Features of LLMs
- Highlights that LLMs are versatile and excel at various language-related tasks due to their extensive training data and parameter count.
- Discusses the emergence of unexpected abilities in LLMs, such as solving arithmetic problems and identifying offensive content.

## 3. LLMs and Foundation Models
Foundation models, often mentioned in conjunction with LLMs, are models trained on diverse data types, including text, images, and audio. These models serve as the foundation for specific downstream tasks through fine-tuning and transfer learning.

### 3.1. Foundation Models
- Explains the concept of foundation models and their multimodal training data.
- Describes the fine-tuning process, in which a pre-trained language model is adapted for different but related tasks.
