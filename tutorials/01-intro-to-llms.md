## 1. What Are Large Language Models?
Historically, computers were limited to understanding a defined set of instructions, typically written in programming languages like Java. However, as computing technology advanced, the need for computers to comprehend natural language commands, such as English, became apparent.

### 1.1. Beginning of NLP
- Introduces Natural Language Processing (NLP) as an interdisciplinary field encompassing linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence.
- Traces the history of NLP from Alan Turing's Turing test to the growth of computational power and machine learning algorithms.

### 1.2. Language Modeling (LM)
- Explains language modeling as a statistical technique for predicting word sequences' probabilities.
- Discusses the shift from n-gram models to neural language models for improved performance.

## 2. Large Language Models (LLMs)
Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful neural language models working on a massive scale. These models consist of neural networks with billions of parameters and are typically trained on vast amounts of unlabeled text data.

### 2.1. Key Features of LLMs
- Highlights that LLMs are versatile and excel at various language-related tasks due to their extensive training data and parameter count.
- Discusses the emergence of unexpected abilities in LLMs, such as solving arithmetic problems and identifying offensive content.

## 3. LLMs and Foundation Models
Foundation models, often mentioned in conjunction with LLMs, are models trained on diverse data types, including text, images, and audio. These models serve as the foundation for specific downstream tasks through fine-tuning and transfer learning.

### 3.1. Foundation Models
- Explains the concept of foundation models and their multimodal training data.
- Describes the fine-tuning process, in which a pre-trained language model is adapted for different but related tasks.
