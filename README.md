## Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). They have been used for a wide range of applications, from chatbots and text generation to translation and summarization. In this repository, we provide tutorials and Python code to help you explore and understand LLMs.

## Tutorials

1. [Introduction to Transformers](tutorials/01-intro-to-transformers.md)
2. [Fine-Tuning a Pretrained Model](tutorials/02-fine-tuning.md)
3. [Text Generation with GPT-3](tutorials/03-text-generation.md)
4. [Sentiment Analysis with BERT](tutorials/04-sentiment-analysis.md)
5. [Chatbots with DialoGPT](tutorials/05-chatbots.md)

These tutorials will cover the fundamentals and practical applications of Large Language Models.
